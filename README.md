## 🛠 Printing Notes (General)

Every printer and resin/filament is different, but here are general tips:

- Print beads and small parts with **fine layer height** for best detail.
- Use **slow lift speeds** for tall, skinny parts to reduce failures.
- For FDM: consider **0.16–0.2mm layer height** and more perimeters for strength.
- For resin: watch out for thin walls; increase wall thickness if needed.
